        Showman is the culmination of all of my ideas since starting my journey into graphics. It is the most challenging, and rewarding project that I’ve worked on. Each time I ran into a problem, I found a solution. 
        
        And I sure did run into a lot of problems. Python was my forte, but to fulfill my dream of creating this, I jumped completely into learning various web technologies from React to AWS. It took trial & error plus my signature night-hawkishness to get this project to where it is.
        
        It uses Blender to render Motion Graphics generated by another project of mine: Rocketeer. It is something I’ve built from the ground up and am pretty proud of. `,
